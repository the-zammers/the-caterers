# Work Log

## Z Cater

### 2024-05-22

- Added some basic files (makefile, gitignore) and set up workspace.
- Spent ages implementing first half of recipe parsing (reading titles and ingredient lists).

### 2024-05-23

- Made ingredient parsing much more robust, less prone to breaking on multi-word ingredients
- Outlined the enums and structs needed for parsing the list of steps

### 2024-05-25

- Implemented the parsing of five commands using POSIX regexes as a proof of concept
- Realized the unfeasibility of the previous method and switched to using PCRE2 regexes
- Finished implementing most of the recipe parsing using PCRE2 regexes (still need to handle the last few lines and see about going back to the previous sections with the new parsing setup)
